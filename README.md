# goGui - HTML Based Gui in Golang

This was just a simple proof of concept for Golang.
I have an interest in starting to develop wth Golang in a cross platform scope with an actual GUI.
Unfotunately no library is flushed out enough yet.

So I decided to use the thrust Golang package to load selfserving HTML files and push them to the user in a chromium browser.
I have it working with normal HTML with templating and static abilities.  I also have a demo application created with AngularJS.
I think from this point forward I will probably make my GUI applications with Go + Thrust + AngularJS
